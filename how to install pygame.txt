Install pygame module for your required version of python :

https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame

*After installing whl file, use command prompt to install the module...

OR

just write this in your command prompt window :

pip install pygame 


*(if it works for you, because it didn't work for me...)


AND Lastly,

Open your python idle and check if the pygame module has been installed properly or not...

by writing and running this in your idle :

import pygame


(if there's no error after running that command, then you're good to go!
but if there's an error try installing other pygame.whl files on the same webpage, for your own version)
